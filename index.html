      <p class="about-story">The Brainwave Bureau began as an unexpected meeting of minds, each with a unique story and a shared passion for bringing people together through the power of ideas.
        <br>
        It all started with Josh, an avid traveler with an insatiable curiosity for new cultures and experiences. During one of his adventures, Josh found himself at a vibrant craft fair organized by Itzi, a logistics expert with a knack for textiles and a deep love for handcrafted arts. Over coffee and conversations about the beauty of global craftsmanship and the challenges of organizing such events, they quickly bonded over their shared belief in the value of knowledge exchange.
        <br>
        Not long after, they crossed paths with Max, an architect and computational designer who was always on the lookout for the next big idea. Max’s passion for innovation and design brought a fresh perspective to their discussions, adding a layer of creative thinking to their budding vision.
        <br>
        And then there was Riley, a world-class football coach known for his ability to inspire and motivate both on and off the field. Riley’s knack for team-building and strategic thinking provided the final piece of the puzzle – a dynamic combination of expertise and enthusiasm that sparked the creation of The Brainwave Bureau.
        <br>
        United by their diverse experiences and a shared commitment to fostering knowledge and inspiration, the four co-founders decided to create an agency like no other – a place where thinkers, doers, and dreamers could gather to share their stories, learn from one another, and spark new ideas.
        <br>
        Today, Josh, now CEO, guides The Brainwave Bureau with his traveler’s spirit and a global outlook. Itzi, the COO, brings her logistical prowess and creative flair to every event we host. Max, the CTO, uses his architectural and computational design expertise to craft seamless, memorable experiences. And Riley, our CFO, brings his coaching skills to ensure that our operations run like a winning team.
        Together, they’ve built The Brainwave Bureau into a vibrant community, where industry experts and curious minds come together to connect, learn, and grow. Our journey has only just begun – and we can’t wait to have you along for the ride.</p>
